## How to Contribute

### 1. Contribution via GitHub (Recommended for Developers)

#### Option A — Open an *Issue*
This is recommended for quickly reporting an error, an inconsistency, or a missing entry.
Please include:
- The affected field(s) or concept(s)
- The justification / context
- The affected language(s) (FR or EN)
- A source or concrete example, if possible

#### Option B — Propose a *Pull Request*
This is recommended for users who wish to submit the data changes directly.
In this case:
- Modify the main data file, such as `data/cooking_classification.csv`,
- OR add a new file in the `contributions/` folder
  Example: `contributions/proposal_2025-12-01_name.csv`
- Clearly indicate the changes in the Pull Request description.

### 2. Submission via Email
For simple corrections or if you prefer a non-technical route, you can send your detailed proposal directly to:
👉 **support[at]bftfed.be**

You can propose:
- Translation corrections (FR/EN)
- New cuisine types
- Addition of keywords
- New sub-categories
- Dietary tags (vegan, halal, gluten-free, etc.)

## Best Practices
- Use both languages (FR/EN) as much as possible in your proposals.
- Respect existing categories and naming conventions.
- Provide concrete examples if the concept is not widely known.
- Avoid duplicates.
- Specify if your proposal applies to countries other than Belgium (for context).

## Validation Process
Submissions are evaluated through the following steps:
1. Internal BFTFED committee review
2. Linguistic validation
3. Culinary verification
4. Status update to `validated` in the reference table
